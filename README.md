This is a basic power generation module built with my Copper Networks API It adds blocks that generate power form variouis sources, 3 are passive (solar panels, thermophotovoltaic generators and passive void generators all generate very small amounts of power for free, fields of them will be nescessary and they depend on specific conditions, clear daylight for solar, lava below and in the nether for thermophotovoltaic and void access for the passive void generator) and 2 are active (the normal funrace and copperfied sculk catalyst (power from deathh of mobs based on xp) all generate larger amounts of power). Use JEI for recipes.

This mod was only recently finished and will likely require future optimisations and language translations outside of English. Contributions on the Github would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you to those within the Fabric Modding Discord who dealt with my often rambling and poorly phrased questions.

Also thank you to ItsMinceraft for taking my rambling and unorganised notes of mod ideas and turning them into a Miro board that is actually readable.
